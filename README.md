This robot is able to switch between melee and 1v1 strategies based on the number of opponents on the field.

The 1v1 robot is based on BasicGFSurfer by Voidious, PEZ, and Bayen.

It is a combination of the movement from BasicSurfer and the gun from GFTargetingBot. See:

The melee version is based on HawkOnFire by Rozu. See:
